Even so, since the sentences did not violate the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which provides greater protections for juvenile offenders than Art. I, sec. 27 of the North Carolina Constitution, and since the Eighth Amendment and section 27 have been interpreted in lockstep, a separate review of defendant's state constitutional claim was unnecessary. Further, defendant's sentences did not implicate\u2013and thus were not in violation of\u2013, 381 N.C. 558 (2022), because he was not a member of the narrow class of juvenile offenders to which that case applied. , No. 267PA21 (N.C.

First, the records consisted of strictly computer-generated data, created without any human judgment or input; therefore, they did not constitute hearsay, which necessarily refers to statements made by a human \"declarant\" capable of making assertions. Second, even though law enforcement later accessed the records with the primary purpose of producing evidence for defendant's trial, the computer systems that generated the cell phone data as part of the phone company's day-to-day operations could not have created the records for that same primary purpose, especially since machines, by their nature, cannot act with intent at all; therefore, the records were not testimonial either. , No. 293PA23-2 (N.C.

Further, the text and history of the Ex Post Facto Clause\u2013along with pertinent caselaw\u2013revealed that retroactive civil laws which do not impose taxes are constitutionally permissible. Finally, the Court noted that the lower appellate court's tiered substantive due process framework analysis was immaterial to defendant's argument, and thus, unnecessary. , No. 109PA22-2 (N.C.
